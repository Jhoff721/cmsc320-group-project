    "[Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/) is a popular application used by book lovers. It allows a user to personalize a library with books they want to read, are currently reading, and have read in the past. It also allows users to explore books by genre, author, trope, and much more. We wanted to dive deeper into the vast collection of books Goodreads stores and what data within each book it holds. We used Goodreads as a stepping stone for what types of correlations and predictions we could make from all this data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Does the genre of the book play a role in the number of ratings? Does the number of ratings decrease the average rating of a book? Do authors tend to stick to one genre? We considered these questions and many more while we explored the data. Asking these questions and analyzing real data enables companies to make evidence-based decisions. For publishers, these insights are vital to determing whether or not to publish a certain book. There are many factors that lead to a successful book and data science can help highlight and understand the important features. In order to address this real-life problem, we decided to use machine learning to predict the average rating of a book.\n",

    "We first needed to collect the data from Goodreads. Luckily, we found that our dataset was already collected by someone on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). Kaggle is an online platform dedicated to the data science community. It allows people to share their data and knowledge with each other. Our dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/middlelight/goodreadsbookswithgenres/data). This dataset contains all books on the Goodreads platform until 2020.\n",

If you have never used Jupyter Notebook before or want to learn more, click [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-use-jupyter-notebook-an-ultimate-guide/). To get started we need to import all the libraries we will be using. We also need to import our Kaggle dataset and put the data into a pandas [DataFrame](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html). [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) is a data analysis and manipulation tool we will use throughout this project. "
