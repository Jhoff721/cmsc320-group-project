We will be using the dataset found here on Kaggle. It’s a dataset of books found on Goodreads, along with their authors, ratings, number of pages, and genres. We’re choosing this dataset because it’s fairly extensive, as it contains over 10,000 titles, covering almost all the books found on Goodreads up until the end of 2020. Additionally, there are several questions about genre and ratings that we think could be answered by analyzing it. Among the questions to be considered are: How does genre and average rating correlate? Additionally, does the number of ratings decrease the average rating?
